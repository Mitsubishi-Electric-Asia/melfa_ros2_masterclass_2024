## __2. MELSOFT Project Files__

MELFA ROS2 Masterclass 2024 utilizes physical and simulated hardware to provide a robust platform with hardware accurate digital twins for MELSEC, MELFA and GOT products. This section describes the purpose and functionality of the included MELSOFT project files.

### __RV-5AS__
- [MELSOFT RT Toolbox3](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/products/rbt/robot/smerit/rt3/index.html) project folder for [MELFA](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/products/rbt/robot/index.html) RV-5AS collaboratie robot. 
- This project folder is used to configure and program a physical RV-5AS robot used in the Masterclass.
- This porject file is used to create and configure a simulated RV-5AS robot that is identical to the physical robot used in the Masterclass.
